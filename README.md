Since there's a way to run external batch apps I thought I should start a downloadable game store to make use of it! 
Many of the games I upload to play might not be amazing most of the time, but it should give people something to actually do in the OS. 
You can download any Jaguar-compatible game or piece of software from its release on GitHub, or get it in JaguarOS Online Store from the top menu bar. 
It'll automatically download in the App(B) folder from getting it within the OS itself, but from GitHub you'll have to manually put it in App(B) yourself. 
It also is required to be called APP.bat or JaguarOS won't recognize it as software that it can run, this goes for any game or software you put in so they'll all have to be named that for the moment. 
I hope you enjoy all the games I put out!
